About Tutorial Challenges 
 
Many of the challenges on HackerRank are difficult and assume that you already know the relevant algorithms 
very well. These tutorial challenges are different. They break down algorithmic concepts into smaller 
challenges, so that you can learn the algorithm by solving the challenges.

These challenges are intended for those who know some programming and now want to learn some algorithms. 
You could be a student majoring in Computers, a self-taught programmer, or an experienced developer who wants 
an active algorithms review!

The first series of challenges covers sorting. The challenges are listed below:

Tutorial Challenges - Sorting

1.Insertion Sort challenges

	Insertion Sort 1 - Inserting
	Insertion Sort 2 - Sorting
	Correctness and loop invariant
	Running Time of Algorithms
	
2. Quicksort challenges

	Quicksort 1 - Partition
	Quicksort 2 - Sorting
	Quicksort In-place (advanced)
	Running time of Quicksort
	
3. Counting sort challenges
	
	Counting Sort 1 - Counting
	Counting Sort 2 - Simple sort
	Counting Sort 3 - Preparing
	Full Counting Sort (advanced)

There will also be some challenges where you'll get to apply what you've learnt.

About the Challenges 
The challenges will describe some topic and then ask you to code a solution. As you progress through the challenges, you will learn some important concepts in algorithms. In each challenge, you will receive input on STDIN and you will need to print the correct output to STDOUT.

For many challenges, helper methods (like an array) will be provided for you to process the input into a useful format. You can use these methods to get started with your program, or you can write your own input methods if you want. Your code just needs to print the right output to each test case.
